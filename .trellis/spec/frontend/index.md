# Frontend Development Guidelines

> React 19 + Vite frontend guidelines for GitPulse.

---

## Overview

The frontend owns state, layout, validation prompts, preview interactions, and Tauri command invocation. Local Git scanning, report rendering, file export, secure credential storage, and other filesystem work stay behind Rust commands.

## Pre-Development Checklist

- [ ] Identify whether the change belongs in React state/UI or a Rust Tauri command.
- [ ] Check `src/model.ts` before adding new frontend shapes, defaults, validators, or command option builders.
- [ ] Keep report generation controls and current scope visible in the workbench.
- [ ] Preserve local-first privacy language and never put raw API keys in plain persisted settings.

## Quality Check

- [ ] `npm run build` passes for TypeScript and production bundling when frontend code changes.
- [ ] Relevant Playwright checks pass or the reason they were not run is documented.
- [ ] UI text remains clear in Chinese and does not hide primary report actions.
- [ ] Tauri command payloads still match `src-tauri/src/models.rs` camelCase serde models.
