# Quality Guidelines

> Code quality standards for frontend development.

---

## Overview

Frontend changes should preserve a reliable local desktop workflow: scan repositories, choose scope, generate a report, optionally polish it, then copy/export it.

---

## Forbidden Patterns

- No Python runtime dependency on `main`.
- No direct filesystem or Git shell work from React; use Tauri commands.
- No raw API keys in localStorage or plain settings.
- No marketing-page layout patterns inside the desktop workbench.
- No hidden primary report controls or hover-only critical controls.

---

## Required Patterns

- Keep local-first privacy and traceability visible in copy and behavior.
- Long-running scan/extract operations should show progress and allow graceful status updates.
- AI failures must fall back to the current local report draft or local template.
- Report history and repository cache writes should be bounded and recover from malformed localStorage.
- Commit evidence detail must preserve repository, branch, date, hash, and original message context.

---

## Testing Requirements

- Run `npm run build` for TypeScript/build verification after frontend changes.
- Run targeted Playwright tests when changing onboarding, workbench generation controls, report history, settings, or export UX.
- For release-impacting changes, follow `CONTRIBUTING.md`: `npm run build`, `npm run test:e2e`, `cd src-tauri && cargo check && cargo test`.

## Tauri WebView2 Dark Mode — Native Controls

On Windows, Tauri uses WebView2 (Chromium). Native form controls (`<input type="date">`, `<select>`, etc.) render their own icons and chrome, which default to light-on-white and become invisible on dark backgrounds. Every native control in a dark theme must be explicitly handled:

1. **`<input type="date/month/week">`**: Set `color-scheme: dark` in the dark theme override (theme.css). Do NOT use `background-image` on date inputs — WebView2 duplicates it infinitely (same bug as select arrows). Do NOT combine `color-scheme: dark` with `filter: invert()` — they cancel each other out. Do NOT use `position: absolute` on `::-webkit-calendar-picker-indicator` to expand the click area — it distorts the icon size. For "click anywhere opens picker" behavior, use a global `showPicker()` event delegation in App.tsx instead.

2. **`<select>`**: Must use `appearance: none` and a custom SVG arrow via `background-image`. WebView2's built-in select arrow renders as an infinite-duplication bug in dark mode without this workaround. Unlike date inputs, `background-image` works on select elements because `appearance: none` disables the native rendering entirely.

3. **General rule**: Never use `background-image` on a native form control that retains its default `appearance`. WebView2 duplicates the background behind the native chrome. Either use `appearance: none` (select) or `color-scheme: dark` (date/month/week). Verify in both light and dark themes on Windows before marking complete.

## Code Review Checklist

- Does this keep Git/filesystem work behind Rust?
- Does every new command payload match `src-tauri/src/models.rs`?
- Are empty and failure states useful without AI?
- Are status messages, validation errors, and labels clear in Chinese?
- Does the UI remain usable in both light and dark themes?
- Are secrets stored only through secure storage or safe environment-variable references?
